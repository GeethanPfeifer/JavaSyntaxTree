# JavaSyntaxTree

This is a tool for generating syntax trees, inspired by jssyntaxtree.

Currently this program is a very early prototype.

## Using the program

### Example Tree:

```
[S [NP [PN Alice ->X]] [VP [V likes] [NP [PN Bob.:X]]]]
```

![See /docs/ExampleTrees/ExampleTree1.png](docs/ExampleTrees/ExampleTree1.png)

Currently the only file format supported is .png files.

Better documentation will come soon.
